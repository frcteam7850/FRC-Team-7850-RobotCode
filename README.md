# FRC-Team-7850-RobotCode
Current Robot Code

# Last Changlog
- added flywheel code
- rough outline for flywheel
- cleaned up some minor things with code to allow for easy flywheel implementatation

# To-Do List
## Programing To-Dos
### Drive
#### Program items
- [x] [Set Motors](https://github.com/frcteam7850/FRC-Team-7850-RobotCode/blob/main/Main%20Robot%20Code/src/main/java/frc/robot/subsystems/DriveSubsystem.java)
- [x] [Diffrental Drive](https://github.com/frcteam7850/FRC-Team-7850-RobotCode/blob/main/Main%20Robot%20Code/src/main/java/frc/robot/subsystems/DriveSubsystem.java)
- [x] [Tank Drive](https://github.com/frcteam7850/FRC-Team-7850-RobotCode/blob/main/Main%20Robot%20Code/src/main/java/frc/robot/commands/TankDriveCmd.java)
- [x] [Arcade Drive](https://github.com/frcteam7850/FRC-Team-7850-RobotCode/blob/main/Main%20Robot%20Code/src/main/java/frc/robot/commands/ArcadeDriveCmd.java)
- [x] [PID Controller](https://github.com/frcteam7850/FRC-Team-7850-RobotCode/blob/main/Main%20Robot%20Code/src/main/java/frc/robot/commands/PIDDriveCmd.java)
- [ ] Auto Move Forward
#### Revise Items
- [ ] [Tune PID Controller](https://github.com/frcteam7850/FRC-Team-7850-RobotCode#pid-tuned)
- [ ] [Test Code](https://github.com/frcteam7850/FRC-Team-7850-RobotCode#tested)
## Build To-Dos
- [ ] Have more then just a chasis
## Eletrical To-Dos
- [x] Wire Drive
- [x] Rewire Drive /(first time)
- [x] Rewire Drive /(second time)
- [ ] Add something else to program besides drive motors
